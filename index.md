## Hi, I am Muhammad Zubair Khan

I also go by MZ. I am an undergraduate at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) majoring in Computer Science. For the past few months, I have been working on an Android Studio App which has helped me explored some basic aspects of Software Development Process. I have also been getting familiar with some Machine Learning concepts. At my current position as an ML research intern, I am working on a sports analytics project which relies heavily on neural networks and data mining. 

I will be using this page to put out source code of my projects.

### My Code

My code will be published below soon!

```java
//TODO: Add my actual code. The given code is just a sample.

public class World2021 {

    public boolean isSocialDistancing;
    public boolean isStayingHome;
    public boolean isWearingMask;
    
    public static final boolean isCovid() {
        if (isSocialDistancing && isStayingHome && isWearingMask) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
}
```
