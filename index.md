# Hi, I am Muhammad Zubair Khan

I also go by MZ. I am an undergraduate at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) majoring in Computer Science. For the past few months, I have been working on an Android Studio App which has helped me explored some basic aspects of Software Development Process. I have also been getting familiar with some Machine Learning concepts. At my current position as an ML research intern, I am working on an NBA basketball analytics project which relies heavily on tensor learning. 

Here is my [resume](docs/Muhammad%20Z%20Khan%20Resume.pdf) further detailing my past and current projects and experiences.

I will be using this page to put out source code of my projects. I'll be putting out my first piece of code soon. Untill then, feel free to checkout [some random stuff](#some-random-stuff) I freestyled below. 

## Some Random Stuff

2020 has not been the greatest year for most of us. This ongoing global pandemic has really taken its toll on many of us. People are relieveed that the page has been turned and that 2021 is here. But it should be noted that it is still _extremely_ important that we still practice **Social Distancing**, **Stay at Home**, and **Wear a Mask** if we need to overcome covid-19 in 2021. As Dr. Anthony Fauci stated recently:
> I think we just have to assume that itâ€™s going to be worse.

No need to panic though. Fauci tells us to **_assume_** that it's going to be worse. So if we continue to practice **Social Distancing**, **Stay at Home**, and **Wear a Mask** in 2021, we should be back to normal by this year. In other ~~words~~ commands:

```java

public class World2021 {

    public boolean isSocialDistancing;
    public boolean isStayingHome;
    public boolean isWearingMask;
    
    public static final boolean isCovid() {
        if (isSocialDistancing && isStayingHome && isWearingMask) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
}
```
